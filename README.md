# insertionFinder
An insertion finder implementation for the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube. Still under progress.

### Goals:
- Prompt the user for the scramble and their skeleton
- It should find the optimal insertions for multiple insertions for both corners and edges
- For more complex insertions (e.g. 3E5C), it should take into account triggers like R U R' U'
- It should return an answer in a reasonable amount of time
